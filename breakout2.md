Breakout #2: Building the Complete Data Collection System

Activity: In small groups, integrate all components into a working automated collection system.

Instructions:

1) Combine the WeatherDataCollector, WeatherDatabase, and orchestrator components

2) Set up automated collection for at least 3 different cities

3) Implement monitoring to track collection success/failure rates

4) Create a simple status dashboard that shows:
    Last collection time for each location
    Success rate over the last 24 hours
    Any recent errors

5) Test the system and ensure it handles errors gracefully

Expected Output:

    A fully integrated automated weather collection system
    Database with collected weather data from multiple locations
    Basic monitoring dashboard showing collection status
    Documentation of the system architecture

Discussion Points:
    How did you handle API rate limiting across multiple locations?
    What monitoring metrics are most important for this system?
    How would you scale this system to handle hundreds of locations?
