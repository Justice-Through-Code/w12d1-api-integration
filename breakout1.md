Breakout #1: Implementing Error-Resistant API Integration

Activity: In pairs, implement a robust weather data collector with comprehensive error handling.

Instructions:

1) Create a WeatherDataCollector class based on the provided template

2) Implement proper error handling for at least 3 different failure scenarios:
        Network connectivity issues
        Invalid API responses
        Rate limiting

3) Add data validation to ensure received data is reasonable

4) Test your implementation with both valid and invalid inputs

5) Document what errors you handled and how

Expected Output:

    A working WeatherDataCollector class with error handling
    Test cases demonstrating error recovery
    Documentation of error scenarios handled
    Validation logic for weather data

Discussion Points:
    What types of errors did you encounter during testing?
    How did your retry logic perform with simulated failures?
    What data validation checks did you implement?
    How would you extend this for multiple weather APIs?
